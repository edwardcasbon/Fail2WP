# This filter is intended to be used with fail2ban and the Fail2WP plugin.
#
# This file should be placed in /etc/fail2ban/filter.d as fail2wp.conf
#
# I'm by no means a fail2ban filter expert, so I'm sure this could do with some
# improvements. It has been tested with fail2ban 0.11.1 on Ubuntu 20.04.LTS and
# Ubuntu 22.04.LTS.
#
# ADVANCED: You may, of course, split these into several different jails and
#           triggers and give them different treatment in fail2ban so that some
#           of the log messages trigger one behavior in fail2ban, and others
#           are ignored or behave differently.
#
# Joaquim Homrighausen <joho@webbplatsen.se>
#
# The intended log messages to trigger fail2ban on are:
#
# @since 1.0.0
#
# Authentication failure for validuser from n.n.n.n port 443
# Invalid email invalidemail from n.n.n.n port 443
# Invalid user invaliduser from n.n.n.n port 443
# User enumeration request from n.n.n.n port 443
# Invalid credentials invalidlogin from n.n.n.n port 443
#
# @since 1.1.0
#
# Blocked REST API request from n.n.n.n port 443
# Unauthenticated REST API request from n.n.n.n port 443
#
# @since 1.2.0
#
# Blocked login attempt from n.n.n.n port 443
# XMLRPC access attempted from n.n.n.n port 443
#
# Other messages:
#
# The Fail2WP plugin can further emit these messages (no action taken):
#
# Unknown error "nnn" during login from n.n.n.n port nnn
# Successful login for validuser from n.n.n.n port nnn
